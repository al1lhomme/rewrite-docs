## Usage

This recipe has required configuration parameters. Recipes with required configuration parameters cannot be activated directly. To activate this recipe you must create a new recipe which fills in the required parameters. In your `rewrite.yml` create a new recipe with a unique name. For example: `com.yourorg.FindImageExample`.
Here's how you can define and customize such a recipe within your rewrite.yml:
```yaml title="rewrite.yml"
---
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: com.yourorg.FindImageExample
displayName: Find image by name example
recipeList:
  - org.openrewrite.kubernetes.search.FindImage:
      repository: gcr.io
      imageName: nginx
      imageTag: v1.2.3
      includeInitContainers: false
      fileMatcher: '**/pod-*.yml'
```

Now that `com.yourorg.FindImageExample` has been defined, activate it and take a dependency on org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-kubernetes:2.9.2 in your build file:
<Tabs groupId="projectType">
<TabItem value="gradle" label="Gradle">

1. Add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy title="build.gradle"
plugins {
    id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("6.26.0")
}

rewrite {
    activeRecipe("com.yourorg.FindImageExample")
    exportDatatables = true
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    rewrite("org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-kubernetes:2.9.2")
}
```
2. Run `gradle rewriteRun` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="maven" label="Maven">

1. Add the following to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
        <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>5.43.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <exportDatatables>true</exportDatatables>
          <activeRecipes>
            <recipe>com.yourorg.FindImageExample</recipe>
          </activeRecipes>
        </configuration>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>org.openrewrite.recipe</groupId>
            <artifactId>rewrite-kubernetes</artifactId>
            <version>2.9.2</version>
          </dependency>
        </dependencies>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
```
2. Run `mvn rewrite:run` to run the recipe.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="moderne-cli" label="Moderne CLI">

You will need to have configured the [Moderne CLI](https://docs.moderne.io/moderne-cli/cli-intro) on your machine before you can run the following command.

```shell title="shell"
mod run . --recipe FindImageExample
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
